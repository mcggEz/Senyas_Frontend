# Sigla App: AI-Powered Barangay Information System

## Overview
The **Sigla App** is a proof-of-concept web application developed specifically for the **GENAIUS HACKATHON 2025**, themed **"AI for the Underserved: Tech AI in Justice"**.   This app aims to bridge the gap in local governance by providing an accessible online platform where residents can easily access barangay services and information.

The hackathon, organized by **Google Developer Groups on Campus UP Manila**, focused on leveraging AI to create innovative solutions for underserved communities. Our team was selected as one of the **five finalists** among numerous participants, highlighting the project’s effectiveness and potential.

A key part of our project was training large language models (LLMs) tailored exclusively for specific organizations, which enhanced the relevance and effectiveness of the AI-driven conversational agent.
